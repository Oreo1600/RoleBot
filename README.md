# RoleBot

This is Roles Bot. It can give different roles to the users, And you can ping all the members of that role by just pinging the role.
Something like discord roles in server. I tried to replicate that. It doesnt have that many features like discord but it works.
Access the bot: <a href = "https://t.me/MrRolesbot">@MrRolesbot</a>

<h4>Commands:</h4>

<code>/start - Check if the bot is alive or not </code>

<code>/setBio - Set your group bio, You can see it in /profile command.</code>

<code>/AddRole - Add a new Role (admin only) 
Usage: /AddRole Role_Name</code>

<code>/GiveRole - Give a role to some user.(Reply to a user while sending this command, again admin only)
Usage - /GiveRole ROLE_NAME</code>

<code>/removeRole - remove a role from user(Reply to a user while sending this command, again admin only)
Usage: /removeRole ROLE_NAME</code>

<code>/profile - See your group profile</code>

<code>/populateRole - Make a button which people can click to get the specific role
Usage: /populateRole ROLE_NAME ROLE_DESCRIPTION</code>

To ping all the members of a role use $roll_name

That's it.
